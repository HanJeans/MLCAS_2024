# MLCAS 2024 / GDSL
## This repository provides all file and code involved in our competition outcome. 


### Dataset
- All dataset is saved in _______ (folder name).
- We have process raw data to build data in _____ (folder name). 


### Code
Python Based Code

### Reference
We have brought model named PheGeMi referring to ["Multi-modal deep learning improves grain yield prediction in wheat breeding by fusing genomics and phenomics (M. Togninalli, et al., 2023)"](https://gdsl.org), and [source code](https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/PheGeMIL).


### Procedure
1. We have matched each csv row and corresponding TP values. 
2. We have implemented PheGeMIL model to train 


### Code implementation

First, we need to install all required package to run the code. Be careful: anaconda does not support some required package, so user should use pip only. 

```
pip install numpy rasterio affine test-tube pytorch pytorch-lightning pot pandas pillow scikit-learn
```

The code has genotype based model, but we are not likely to apply it because it has

## Backquotes
As Kanye West said:
> We're Living the future

## Inline code
I think you should use an `<div>` element here instead. 
```python
def add(a1, a2):
 return a1 + a2
```
